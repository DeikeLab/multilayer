# multilayer
Code for multilayer solver.
## Working example
1. Compile the required fortran library by running
  ```
  cd $BASILISK/ppr/
  make
  ````
2. Under ./working_example, run `sh produce.sh NAME` to generate a folder fNAME that contains the executable. NAME can be either test or test_adaptive (without extension). test is quadtree without adapt_wavelet.
3. Copy ./pre_10layer or ./pre_5layer into the fNAME folder and name it ./pre. This folder contains the synthesized initial wave field and velocity field. Run `mkdir surface` to creat a folder that the program writes output to.
4. Run `./test_adaptive NLAYER MAXLEVEL MINLEVEL ETAE TEND`. The input parameters are number of layers, max level, min level, max error for eta and the ending time respectively.
5. If that throws out an error, try changing the nl (number of layers) value directly in the code to desired value instead of inputting it as an argument. If the error persists, try use different max and min level (I don't know why these make a difference but they did...)
